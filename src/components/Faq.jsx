                    We live in a truly amazing time in that there is a wealth of information that can be had for 
                    free or very cheap through websites such as Youtube. Unfortunately, creating content on 
                    these platforms is almost as easy as consuming it, so nearly anyone can do it. This has resulted 
                    in a lot of bad information being passed around. And even if you are able to parse through the bad 
                    information, there is no structure or feedback to the 'lessons'.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By studying with a qualified private instructor, such as at Blevins Percussion, you will receive 
                    a long-term comprehensive lesson plan designed to help you reach your personal goals as efficiently 
                    as possible. Not only that, but you will also receive feedback on what you're doing correctly as 
                    well as what you can improve upon as well as <em>how</em> to improve.

                    Maybe you are in a band program at your high school or middle school. In that kind of situation, your 
                    band director has a tremendous amount of work on their plate. They are responsible for teaching reading, 
                    technique, style, etc. for well over 100 students on several different instruments. Not only that, but 
                    most band directors only receive minimal training in percussion, typically relegated to a single class 
                    that lasts for only one college semester. You might be fortunate enough to have a percussion instructor 
                    that comes to your school, but even in that situation you will most likely only see them for anywhere from 
                    one to several hours per week in which their attention has to be divided among all percussionists in the 
                    class.

                <p>
                    With private instruction, you are guaranteed dedicated one-on-one time each week that will be spent working 
                    on your specific goals, and improving upon your strengths and weaknesses to make you a better player.

                <h2>How should I choose a private instructor?</h2>
            </div>
            <div className='answer'>
                <p>
                    Choosing the right private instructor is an important decision and one that shouldn't be taken lightly.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    <strong>Choose a private instructor who has 'walked the walk' and not just 'talked the talk'</strong>, 
                    so to speak. The goal of learning an instrument is to perform with other musicians on stage, so you should choose 
                    an instructor who has extensive live performance experience and not someone who has spent most of their time playing 
                    in the garage with their friends or playing along to recorded music at home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>They should be well-rounded</strong> in both technique and styles. It should be obvious that you will want 
                    to choose a teacher who is knowledgeable in your preferred style of music, but you should also choose a teacher that 
                    knows many different styles and techniques. Your goal should be to become a well-rounded musician, especially if you 
                    plan on being a working musician one day. You teacher should work to broaden your horizons and introduce you to styles 
                    of music that you had never even considered before. Also, learning other styles of music can help you excel at your 
                    chosen style of music. I wouldn't be quite as good of a rock drummer if I didn't know what I know about Latin and 
                    Afro-Cuban drumming. And I wouldn't be nearly as good at country music without knowing what I know about funt and 
                    jazz drumming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>They should be a strong reader</strong>, and they should teach you how to read music. Most of these points 
                    are non-negotiable, but that goes double for this one. Learning to read music is an <em>absolutely essential </em> 
                    skill for all musicians, and especially for drummers and percussionists! That being said, the degree to which you should 
                    learn to read will vary depending upon your personal goals. If you are planning on studying music in college or 
                    your high school marching band or concert band, being able to read at a high level is extremely important. However, 
                    if your goal is to play with a touring rock or country band, being able to read at an intermediate level will probably 
                    be sufficient.

                <h2>Why should I take lessons at Blevins Percussion?</h2>
            </div>
            <div className='answer'>
                <p>
                    First and foremost, I meet all of the qualifications listed above. I have performed professionally in a variety of 
                    different styles of music, including with the Chattanooga Symphony as well as several touring rock and country bands 
                    througout the southeastern United States. From 2010-2022 I worked as a full-time drum/percussion instructor and touring 
                    musician based in Birmingham, Alabama. Not only that, but I have helped hundreds of students reach their personal goals 
                    of playing in local bands, achieving spots in school honor bands, attaining music scholarships, and I have even had several 
                    students go on to pursue careers as professional musicians and educators.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Second, I do not teach drum lessons on electronic drum sets. One of the primary aspects of my lessons that helps my students 
                    excel is my attention to technique, and one of the most important aspects of any instrument is how to play the instrument with 
                    proper technique. The problem with electronic drumsets is that they sound the same no matter how you hit them. By only teaching 
                    lessons on acoustic drumsets, I work on training my students' ears to recognize when they are using poor technique and to be 
                    able to fix their technique in order to get a better sound. That is virtually impossible to do on an electronic drumset. If you 
                    are only playing lessons on an electronic drumset, you are only receiving half of an education.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have nearly unlimited patience. I understand that not every student moves at the same pace, and some students need 
                    a little more time and attention than others. That's one of the great things about private lessons: we can move as 
                    quickly or as slowly as you require. One of the compliments that I receive most from my students and they parents is that 
                    I am always calm and patient, and that my patience is infectious. I actively fight feelings of frustration, because frustration 
                    is the enemy of progress.
